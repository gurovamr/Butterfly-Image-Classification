# Butterfly-Image-Classifier

Repository for the final project of the Neural Network class.

## Description

This file contains the code for training and testing the neural network model used for classifying butterfly images.

## Usage

To use this classifier, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies in requirements.txt are installed. 
2. Run the script in the Jupyter file
3. The script will train the model using the provided dataset and then test the model.

## Dataset

Images contains a total of 832 images in PNG format. Ten butterfly categories are included.
Naming convention: Each image is preceded by the category ID of the butterfly (001, 002, ..., 010).

The scientific (Latin) names of the butterfly categories are:
0: Danaus plexippus
1: Heliconius charitonius
2: Heliconius erato
3: Junonia coenia
4: Lycaena phlaeas
5: Nymphalis antiopa
6: Papilio cresphontes
7: Pieris rapae
8: Vanessa atalanta
9: Vanessa cardui

The dataset used for this project can be found at https://zenodo.org/records/7559420.
