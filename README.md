# Butterfly-Image-Classifier

Repository for the final project of the Neural Network class.

## Description

This file contains the code for training and testing the neural network model used for classifying butterfly images.

## Usage

To use this classifier, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. (List them here)
2. Run the script with the command: `python classifier.py`
3. The script will train the model using the provided dataset and then test the model.

## Dataset

Images contains a total of 832 images in PNG format. Ten butterfly categories are included.
Naming convention: Each image is preceded by the category ID of the butterfly (001, 002, ..., 010).

The scientific (Latin) names of the butterfly categories are:
001: Danaus plexippus
002: Heliconius charitonius
003: Heliconius erato
004: Junonia coenia
005: Lycaena phlaeas
006: Nymphalis antiopa
007: Papilio cresphontes
008: Pieris rapae
009: Vanessa atalanta
010: Vanessa cardui

The dataset used for this project can be found at https://zenodo.org/records/7559420.
